# Plan for Developing an AI Trading Agent

Objectives and Approach

The goal is to build an AI-driven trading agent that can eventually trade various assets (crypto, stocks, bonds, futures), starting with cryptocurrency markets. Crypto is an ideal starting point due to its 24/7 availability and well-documented APIs
medium.com
. The agent will leverage both technical analysis and fundamental/news signals (“all of the above”), using Rust as the primary language (for performance and reliability) and integrating a large language model (LLM) via llama.cpp for interpreting news or sentiment. We will begin by paper trading (simulated trading with fake capital) to validate performance before risking real funds. The trading horizon is short-term (intraday to multi-day) – fast reactions to market-moving information, without ultra-high-frequency complexities.

Key design preferences:

Language & Performance: Use Rust for low memory usage and high speed. Rust’s efficiency allows each bot to run in as little as ~5–10 MB of RAM, whereas an equivalent Python bot might need 100–200 MB
medium.com
. High performance ensures the agent can react as fast as possible to signals
medium.com
. An asynchronous runtime (e.g. Tokio) will handle concurrent tasks like market data streaming and web requests efficiently
medium.com
.

LLM Integration: Utilize the LLM (via llama.cpp bindings) primarily for natural language data analysis – for example, parsing news headlines or social media feeds to gauge market sentiment. This brings contextual understanding that simple keyword-based sentiment tools lack
profitview.net
.

Technical + Fundamental Signals: Combine technical indicators (e.g. price patterns, RSI, moving averages) with fundamental or sentiment cues (news, tweets, on-chain data) to inform trades. The agent will consider both types of signals to make decisions, increasing robustness to different market conditions
profitview.net
.

Risk Management First: Employ strict risk controls (e.g. stop-loss, position sizing limits) from the start. Even a well-designed AI can misread events or react too slowly to sudden news, so safety nets are critical
profitview.net
.

Incremental Development: Start with a simple, working prototype and iterate. It’s best to begin with a minimal strategy and infrastructure, then refine by testing additional data sources, models, and strategies
profitview.net
. We will paper trade early and often – first on historical data (backtesting), then in real-time simulation – to evaluate performance and adjust before live deployment.

System Architecture Overview

The AI trading agent’s system will be composed of modular components that handle data ingestion, analysis, decision-making, and trade execution. Designing the system with a modular (hexagonal) architecture will ensure it’s easy to extend to new data sources or markets in the future
medium.com
. Below are the core components of the architecture:

Data Collection & Ingestion: This module connects to external data sources that drive trading decisions:

Market Data Feeds: Stream real-time price data (ticks or candlesticks) from crypto exchanges. For instance, connect to an exchange like Binance via its WebSocket or REST API to receive live order book updates or 1-minute OHLC candlesticks
medium.com
. 1-minute resolution is a good starting point for short-term strategies (as used in one Rust bot example)
medium.com
, but the system should allow configurable intervals (even down to seconds) to balance speed vs. noise.

News and Social Media: Monitor news outlets and platforms (Twitter/X feeds, RSS news feeds, etc.) for headlines or posts that can move markets. “Known places that react fast” include crypto news sites, influential Twitter accounts, Reddit, and possibly on-chain analytics (e.g. alerts for large transfers). The agent will fetch these in near real-time (e.g. polling RSS/Twitter API every few seconds or using webhooks) and pass the text to the LLM or a sentiment analyzer.

On-chain Data (optional): Especially for crypto, consider on-chain metrics (like big wallet movements or DeFi liquidations) as they often precede price moves. These can be fetched from APIs or blockchain node data if needed, though this may be a later addition.

Rust’s concurrency (via Tokio async tasks) will enable handling multiple data streams in parallel with low latency
medium.com
. Each data source will be implemented as an adapter (using Rust traits for abstraction) so that, for example, switching from one exchange API to another, or adding a new news source, doesn’t require rewriting core logic
medium.com
.

Data Processing & Storage: Collected data is fed into in-memory buffers or a lightweight database:

Market Data Store: Maintain recent price history (e.g. last N minutes of candlesticks or tick data) in memory for quick access by the strategy. This can simply be a ring buffer or time-series structure updated in real-time. For longer-term analysis or backtesting, store historical data in a small database (Rust’s Diesel ORM can manage an SQLite or Postgres DB to log prices and trades
medium.com
).

State & Position Tracking: Keep track of the agent’s current portfolio state (cash balance, current holdings, open orders) in a state object or database table. This state will be used by the strategy to decide position sizes and must persist between runs if needed. Using an abstract persistence layer (trait-based) means you could easily swap a database or in-memory store without changing strategy code
medium.com
.

Analysis Modules: Two parallel analysis streams will convert raw data into actionable signals:

Technical Analysis Module: Compute technical indicators and patterns from market price data. For example, calculate momentum oscillators and trend indicators:

Relative Strength Index (RSI): to detect overbought/oversold conditions
medium.com
.

Moving Averages (e.g. EMA cross): to gauge trend direction or identify “golden crosses”
medium.com
.

Bollinger Bands: to measure volatility and mean-reversion opportunities
medium.com
.

Other indicators (MACD, volume spikes, etc.) as needed. These indicators will be updated continuously as new data comes in. Technical signals (e.g. “RSI < 30 = oversold” or “Price crosses above 50-EMA”) will be fed into the decision engine. Note: Focus on a small set of proven indicators initially to avoid overfitting. (One tip from practitioners is to use indicators available on exchange charts, so you can verify your calculations against real market data easily
medium.com
.)

News & Sentiment Analysis Module: Leverage AI/NLP to interpret unstructured textual data:

Use the LLM (via llama.cpp) or a specialized NLP model to perform sentiment analysis on news headlines, tweets, and other text. For instance, a model like FinBERT or GPT-based classifiers can assign a sentiment score (positive/negative/neutral) to news related to the assets
dev.to
. This can alert the agent to bullish or bearish market sentiment in real-time.

Use context-aware analysis: Unlike simple sentiment libraries (e.g. VADER) which might misjudge finance-specific context, advanced models can understand nuances (e.g. a headline about “limited Bitcoin supply” is actually positive for price, even if the phrasing sounds negative)
profitview.net
. The LLM can be prompted with domain knowledge (“You are a crypto trading expert...”) to rate news on a -1 to 1 scale of bearish to bullish
profitview.net
profitview.net
.

Potentially, classify news by topic (regulation, hacks, macro economy) or identify if it’s breaking news that warrants immediate action. The analysis module might output signals like “NewsSentiment = +0.8 (very positive)” or “Alert: Exchange hack news detected” which the strategy can use.

Efficiency considerations: Running a large model for every news item could be slow. To keep reaction fast, consider using a smaller fine-tuned model or an approach like batching headlines together for analysis
profitview.net
. The llama.cpp binding allows running models locally; using a quantized smaller LLM or even distilling a larger model into a smaller one for speed could be an advanced optimization (as done via teacher-student distillation in some projects)
chainstack.com
. In early stages, a straightforward approach of using a pre-trained sentiment model with moderate size is acceptable.

Both the technical and sentiment analysis components run continuously and publish signals to the decision engine. The architecture can treat these as plug-in services – for example, one could add more data feeds (on-chain metrics, macroeconomic news feeds) later without altering core logic, by writing new adapters that produce signals.

Decision Engine (Strategy Logic): This is the “brain” of the trading agent. It consumes signals from technical and fundamental analysis and decides when to buy, sell, or hold an asset. The strategy can evolve in sophistication over time:

Initial Rule-Based Strategy: Start with a simple heuristic or rule-based strategy combining a couple of signals. For example: if technical indicator shows oversold (RSI low) and sentiment is positive, then buy; if RSI is overbought or a negative news hits, sell. These rules can be hard-coded and later tuned. The simplicity helps in understanding the agent’s behavior and is a good baseline.

Machine Learning/AI Strategy: As data accumulates, we can train models to make trading decisions. Two approaches stand out:

Supervised Learning: Create a model that takes in features (technical indicators values, sentiment scores, etc.) and predicts the next price move or optimal action. One could label historical data (with past news and prices) to train, for example, a classifier that outputs buy/hold/sell signals.

Reinforcement Learning (RL): Model the trading environment as an RL environment (state could include recent price action and news sentiment; actions are buy/sell/hold; reward is profit). Use frameworks (like Gymnasium
chainstack.com
) to train an agent policy that maximizes returns. This would involve simulating many trading episodes on historical data. An RL approach might capture sequential decision-making better (e.g. learning to hold or close positions based on evolving news).

LLM-Based Reasoning: Another experimental approach is prompting the LLM to reason about trades (“Given these indicators and news, what is the recommended action?”). However, relying on an LLM alone for decisions can be unpredictable. It’s safer to use it for analysis and use a deterministic strategy logic or trained policy for execution.

Multi-Asset and Multi-Strategy Support: Design the decision engine to support multiple strategies or asset pairs concurrently. Using an object-oriented or trait-based design (e.g., each strategy implements a common interface like Agent trait) allows running different bots for different coins or different strategies in parallel
medium.com
. This will be useful as we expand beyond crypto or test various strategies. Each strategy instance can operate independently (possibly each in its own async task or thread).

Execution & Trade Management: This module takes the decisions from the strategy and executes trades, either in simulation or live:

Paper Trading Execution: Initially, we will implement a simulated execution environment. When the strategy issues a buy/sell signal, the execution module will record a virtual trade as if executed at the current market price (or the next tick). It will update the portfolio state (decrease cash, increase asset quantity, etc.) accordingly. This can be as simple as appending to a trades log and updating balances in memory. For more realism, one can incorporate transaction costs (e.g. 0.1% fee on each trade as per Binance fees
medium.com
) and even slippage (e.g. assume a slight price impact for large orders) in the simulation logic.

Exchange Integration: When moving to real trading, this module will interface with exchange APIs to place actual orders. For crypto, that means building REST API calls (or using an exchange’s SDK) to send buy/sell orders and check status. Rust’s reqwest crate can handle HTTP requests, and with tokio we can maintain responsive, non-blocking order submission
medium.com
. Some exchanges also provide websocket trading streams for order acknowledgments. Security (API keys management) and error handling (retries, network issues) are important considerations here.

Order Types & Management: The agent might start with simple market orders for immediate execution during paper testing. Later, it could employ limit orders, stop orders, etc., as needed. The execution module should abstract these details so that the strategy can just say “buy X units” and the module handles the rest (whether in sim or live mode).

Paper Trading vs. Live Toggle: Implement a mode switch. In simulation mode, all trades go to an internal simulator; in live mode, trades go to the exchange. This can be configured via a flag so we can seamlessly transition to real trading when ready, or even run in parallel (one instance in sim, one live as a shadow).

Risk Management: An essential part of the architecture is monitoring and limiting risk:

Stop-Loss & Take-Profit: The agent should automatically place or simulate stop-loss orders to cap downside on each position. For example, if a trade is opened, immediately set a stop-loss at a defined percentage loss or based on volatility. This saved a news-based strategy in testing – big unexpected news can flip markets before the bot reacts, so a stop-loss prevents catastrophic loss
profitview.net
. Take-profit levels can also lock in gains on spikes.

Position Sizing & Leverage: Define rules for how much of the portfolio to risk on any given trade. This could be a fixed fraction (e.g. never risk more than 5% of capital on one trade) or based on confidence (e.g. higher sentiment score allows slightly larger position). In early stages, keep positions small to minimize risk. If using leverage (margin trading), set conservative limits or avoid initially.

Diversification and Correlation: As the agent may eventually trade multiple assets, it should be aware of correlation risk (e.g. not betting the farm on two coins that move identically). The architecture can include a risk manager that looks at overall exposure and can override or scale down trades if total risk is too high.

Safety Checks: Implement sanity checks (e.g., pause trading if losses exceed a daily threshold, or if the input data is abnormal such as API feed disconnects). These can prevent the agent from going rogue due to faulty inputs or bugs.

Monitoring & Evaluation Tools: Build tools to observe the agent’s performance and facilitate debugging:

Logging: Every decision and trade should be logged. For example, log entries might include timestamp, price, indicators values, sentiment summary, decision (buy/sell/hold), size, and resulting portfolio balance. These logs are invaluable for later analysis and troubleshooting.

Performance Metrics: Track key metrics like profit & loss (PnL) over time, return on investment, win/loss ratio, maximum drawdown, Sharpe ratio, etc. This can be done by analyzing the trade log. Storing these in a database and perhaps exposing them via a small web dashboard is useful for long-running agents. (One Rust bot project logged strategy performance to SQLite and served a web UI with Actix and Dioxus for monitoring
medium.com
medium.com
 – a similar approach can be used if a UI is needed).

Alerts: Set up alerts for important events (e.g., if a trade fails, or if the portfolio drops by X%). In a simple form, the bot could send an email or message when certain triggers hit. This ensures you can intervene if something goes wrong during live trading.

Extensibility for Other Markets: The architecture is designed to be extensible so that adding new asset classes (stocks, futures, etc.) is straightforward:

Abstract the market-specific logic. For example, have an Exchange interface/trait that can be implemented by different exchange APIs (Binance for crypto, Alpaca or Interactive Brokers for stocks, etc.). The rest of the system calls the exchange trait methods (like get_price() or place_order()), and the specific implementation handles the API details
medium.com
. This way, adding a new exchange or market means writing a new adapter without changing core logic.

Similarly, separate strategy logic from asset specifics: a strategy might be somewhat universal (e.g., trend-following) but will need tuning per asset. The system could allow different parameter sets for different assets, or entirely different strategy modules for, say, crypto vs equities (which have different market hours and drivers).

When scaling to high-frequency scenarios, further optimizations (like co-locating servers near exchange servers, using low-level network optimizations, etc.) might be required. However, given the chosen timeframe (intraday/multi-day), the current Rust-based design (with its performance advantage) should suffice for timely reactions. The agent should already be faster than a human trader at digesting data and placing orders, which is a key edge
medium.com
.

In summary, the architecture comprises a pipeline from data inputs → analysis → decision → execution, with cross-cutting concerns for risk management and monitoring. Rust’s strengths (speed, safety, concurrency) will underpin the system to handle data and decisions in real-time. The use of an LLM for news analysis enriches the agent’s view of the market’s context, enabling it to react not just to price ticks but to why the market might be moving (e.g. a sudden regulatory news). All components are modular, enabling progressive enhancement (e.g., adding more indicators or new data feeds) without major refactoring.

Development Steps (Roadmap)

Following is a step-by-step plan to develop the trading agent, from initial setup through to a live trading prototype. We will start simple (basic data and strategy on one market) and iteratively expand functionality:

Environment Setup & Tech Stack Confirmation:

Set up Rust project: Initialize a new Rust repository for the trading agent. Ensure Rust is updated and required libraries can be added (for example, add dependencies like tokio for async runtime, reqwest for HTTP API calls, serde for JSON parsing, etc.).

Integrate LLM bindings: Incorporate the llama.cpp Rust bindings that are already prepared. Test loading a basic model (e.g. a smaller LLaMA model) and running a simple prompt to confirm the setup. This will later be used in the sentiment module.

Select Exchange API: Decide which crypto exchange or trading platform to use initially. A popular choice is Binance due to its low fees and comprehensive API
medium.com
, but others like Coinbase or Kraken could work. Obtain API keys if needed (for public data, not always required). Set up config files or environment variables for API credentials (keeping keys secure).

Dev environment: Also prepare any needed development tools (e.g. set up Git for version control). If considering later deployment, choose a platform (could be as simple as running on a local machine or a cloud VM; Rust’s efficiency can keep costs low
medium.com
 if using cloud). However, initially you can run everything locally.

Data Ingestion Implementation:

Market Data Feed: Implement a module (e.g. data_feed.rs) that connects to the exchange’s API to fetch price data. Start with historical data download (for backtesting later): use REST endpoints to pull recent candlesticks for the chosen trading pair (e.g. BTC/USDT)
medium.com
. Then implement real-time data streaming: for instance, subscribe to Binance WebSocket for live ticker or kline updates. Use asynchronous tasks to continuously receive data and update internal data structures.

News/Sentiment Feed: Implement a simple news fetching routine. To start, you can use a readily available source like Google News RSS for crypto topics or Twitter API for specific accounts/keywords. For example, use an HTTP GET to a news RSS feed (as the ProfitView bot did with Google News RSS on a 1-minute cron)
profitview.net
. Parse the returned XML to extract headlines. If Twitter access is available, subscribe to tweets from influential figures or use a service that provides a feed of relevant tweets.

Data handling: As data arrives, store it appropriately. Price data can be stored in a struct or DB table for candles (timestamp, open, high, low, close, volume). Ensure new data points are appended and old ones are dropped if not needed (to prevent memory bloat). For news, you might collect a list of recent headlines (ensuring you don’t process the same headline twice).

Testing: At this step, run the data collection modules independently to ensure they are working. For example, verify that you can receive real-time price updates and that news headlines are being fetched periodically. This can be tested by printing outputs or writing to log files. No trading decisions are made yet – this is just to confirm our “ears” to the market are functioning.

Technical Analysis Module Development:

Using the market data feed, implement calculation of one or two technical indicators as a starting point. For example, calculate RSI for the past 14 periods on the 1-minute data, or a moving average crossover (e.g. 50-period and 200-period EMA). You can write functions for these or use a Rust crate if available (ensure it’s well-maintained). It might be instructive to implement a couple manually to fully control the logic.

The module should update indicator values whenever new price data comes in. Organize this as a separate thread or task that listens for new tick/candle events and then computes the indicators in real-time.

Validate calculations: To ensure correctness, compare the computed indicators with a known source. For instance, log the RSI value and cross-check it against Binance’s chart or a TradingView chart for the same symbol/timeframe
medium.com
. This helps catch any calculation mistakes or timing misalignments.

Expand technical signals if needed: for example, also compute Bollinger Bands to measure deviation from the moving average
medium.com
. The focus initially is on a small set of meaningful indicators that will feed into the trading logic.

By the end of this step, the agent should be processing live price data and maintaining updated technical indicators in memory.

Sentiment Analysis Module Development:

Incorporate the LLM (or an NLP model) to analyze text from the news feed. Start with a straightforward approach: take the latest headline or set of headlines and compute an overall sentiment score. For instance, you might fine-tune or prompt the LLM to output a score from -1 (very bearish) to +1 (very bullish) for a given news snippet
profitview.net
profitview.net
.

If using llama.cpp with a local model, craft a prompt that lists recent headlines and asks the model for a sentiment judgment. (Ensure to keep the prompt concise to fit model context windows and run quickly. You could also explore using a smaller model like a fine-tuned FinBERT if available to run in Rust.)

Alternatively, if the llama integration is complex to do immediately, use a placeholder method: e.g., integrate a Python script for sentiment (with something like VADER or a simple classifier) to verify the pipeline end-to-end, then swap in the LLM when ready. But keep in mind the limitations of simple models – context-aware LLM analysis is a key differentiator
profitview.net
.

Test the sentiment module by feeding it example news: does it output intuitive scores? For instance, test with a clearly positive headline (“Big firm invests in Bitcoin”) vs a negative one (“Exchange hacked...”) and see if the scores make sense. Adjust the prompting or model choice as needed.

Output signal: Define how the sentiment info will be represented for the strategy. Perhaps maintain a variable like currentSentimentScore that updates with the latest news sentiment, and/or flags for extremely positive/negative news events. The module might also maintain a short history (e.g. sentiment of last 5 news items) for trend detection.

At this stage, we have two parallel streams of processed data: technical indicators and a sentiment score/feed.

Strategy & Decision Engine Implementation:

Develop a basic strategy that ingests the signals from technical and sentiment modules and decides trading actions. Begin with a paper logic (no real orders yet). For example:
If price is in an “oversold” technical condition and recent sentiment is moderately positive, then signal a Buy (going long).
If price hits an “overbought” condition or a sharply negative news drops, then signal a Sell (or exit a long position).
This can be encoded in an if/else structure or simple state machine. The strategy also needs to consider whether it currently holds a position or is in cash, etc., to decide between entering or exiting.

Keep the initial strategy logic simple and explainable. The aim is to have a baseline strategy that we can test. For instance, Strategy v1: “Buy 100% of portfolio in asset when RSI < 30 and news sentiment > 0; sell completely when RSI > 70 or sentiment turns negative.” (Just as a starting rule set.)

Implement the strategy as a function or thread that periodically (e.g. every minute or on each new data tick) evaluates the conditions and sets a desired position (e.g. desired position = 1 BTC or 0 BTC). This can trigger trade signals that the execution module will act on.

Paper Trading Mode: At first, wire the strategy to a simulation execution: instead of sending orders to an exchange, it will call a simulator (which we’ll build in the next step) to log the trade. For now, ensure that the logic to invoke a trade (buy/sell) can call an abstract execute_trade(action, amount) interface that is implemented by either the simulator or a real trader. This abstraction will let us switch between paper and live trading easily.

Dry-run the strategy with dummy data: you can feed in a sequence of prices and a sentiment pattern that you create to see if the logic does what you expect. Alternatively, print out the strategy’s decision variables (RSI value, sentiment score, decision) in real-time as the live data flows, to manually verify it behaves sensibly.

Paper Trading Execution & Portfolio Simulation:

Develop the trade simulator that will handle orders from the strategy during testing. This simulator will update a fake portfolio. Key components:

A portfolio state (cash balance and asset holdings, initially say $10,000 and 0 BTC for example).

Functions to “execute” a buy or sell: if strategy says “buy X units” or “spend Y dollars on BTC,” the simulator will check the current market price from the data feed and calculate how many units can be bought, subtract from cash, add to BTC holdings. Vice versa for sells (calculate proceeds, add to cash, reduce holdings). Include a small fee to mimic exchange costs (e.g. subtract 0.1% of the trade value as fee)
medium.com
.

Record each trade in a trade log (timestamp, action, price, size, new balance etc.).

Support basic order types: start with market orders (immediate full execution at the latest price). We can ignore limit orders in simulation to keep it simple (or assume they execute at requested price if that price occurs in the data stream).

Tie the simulator into the strategy: the strategy’s trade signals now call the simulator’s execute function. As the simulation runs, the portfolio state will evolve.

Backtesting: Before testing live paper trading, do an initial historical backtest. Use historical price data (and if available, historical news sentiment approximations) to replay past market conditions. Run the strategy logic on this data and see how it would have performed. This can be done by reading a history file and looping through it, feeding it into the strategy in chronological order. Evaluate results: did it make profit? How large were drawdowns? This helps catch logical issues and adjust parameters.

Run Live Simulation: With backtesting confidence, run the agent in real-time paper trading mode. Over a period (say a few days or weeks), let it ingest live data and make trades on the simulator. Observe its behavior and performance metrics. Because this is fake money, we can safely see how it handles real market volatility and news in a hands-off manner.

Analyze the trade log and performance periodically. Look for patterns like: Is it trading too often? Did it miss big moves or get caught in bad trades? This will inform adjustments.

Evaluation and Iteration:

Based on the paper trading results, refine the strategy and modules. This phase may be repeated multiple times:

Adjust Strategy Rules/Parameters: Perhaps the thresholds for indicators need tuning (you might use a hyperparameter optimization tool like Optuna as done in a Rust bot project
medium.com
 to find optimal RSI thresholds, etc.). Or you may introduce additional rules (for example, require a minimum sentiment strength before trading, or incorporate a time-based filter to avoid trading during certain hours if performance is poor then).

Incorporate More Data: If the agent missed reactions to certain events, consider adding those data sources. For instance, if a big move happened due to a tweet that wasn’t in the news feed, consider adding a Twitter stream for that influencer. The plan is to iterate fast by testing different news sources and models, keeping what works and dropping what doesn’t
profitview.net
.

Improve Sentiment Analysis: Evaluate whether the LLM’s output correlated well with actual market reactions. If not, you might try a different model or fine-tune the existing one on crypto news data. The ProfitView experiment showed that OpenAI’s GPT models captured nuanced sentiment effectively for finance
profitview.net
. With llama.cpp, consider fine-tuning a model on finance text to get similar nuance, or use a domain-specific model like FinBERT as an alternative reference.

Risk Tune-Up: Check if the stop-loss and other risk measures triggered appropriately. Adjust the stop-loss percentage or logic if the simulation shows it either stopped out too often or allowed too large losses. Also verify that position sizing was reasonable; maybe implement a more dynamic sizing (like volatility-based position sizing) if needed.

During each iteration, only change one or two things at a time and test again (either via backtest or another forward testing period). This controlled experimentation approach will help identify what improvements actually lead to better performance.

Live Trading Preparation:

Once the agent shows consistent positive performance in paper trading over a significant period (e.g. it achieves a stable profit or other KPIs over several weeks), plan the transition to live trading with real funds (starting very small).

Connect Exchange Execution: Implement the real trade execution module by utilizing exchange API endpoints. For example, use the Binance REST API to place orders
medium.com
. At this stage, it’s wise to use the exchange’s testnet or sandbox if available (Binance offers a testnet for futures and some for spot via API). This allows end-to-end testing of order submission without real money. Use testnet API keys and ensure the code can switch between testnet and mainnet easily (perhaps via configuration).

Dry Run on Exchange: Attempt a few test trades on the exchange through the API (perhaps manually triggered) to ensure the API integration works (order formatting, authentication, handling responses). Incorporate robust error handling – e.g., retry on transient failures, and graceful handling of rejections or timeouts.

Security Checks: Before going live, double-check that API keys are secure and that the trading logic won’t do something crazy on an error (for instance, have a kill-switch if too many orders are sent too quickly or if certain unexpected conditions arise). Also, re-confirm the risk management is in place so the real account is protected from outsized losses.

Live Trading (Small Scale) and Monitoring:

Deploy the agent to trade live with a minimal amount of capital (an amount you are willing to risk entirely). This could be on a cloud instance or your local machine. Running on a server near the exchange servers (for lower latency) is ideal if doing very fast trades, but for our intraday approach a standard cloud VM or local machine is fine to start.

Closely monitor the bot’s live performance. This means watching the logs, and possibly having the web dashboard or monitoring metrics running. Pay attention to how the bot handles real-world hiccups (exchange downtime, API latency, unexpected news). Ensure the stop-loss works on a live exchange as expected.

It’s prudent to keep a human eye on the bot especially in early live trading. If it behaves oddly or market conditions change drastically (e.g. major crash), be ready to pause it. Early live trading is as much a test of the infrastructure in real conditions as it is of the strategy.

Continuous Improvement and Scaling:

If live results are promising, gradually increase the scope: trade a bit more capital, or add another crypto pair to trade (only if the strategy is generalized or you have a separate strategy instance per asset). Always add one thing at a time and observe.

Expand to other asset classes once the crypto bot is stable. For stocks, for example, you’d integrate a stock broker API (like Alpaca’s API, which could be used similarly to place equity orders
dev.to
). Recognize the differences: stocks have limited trading hours and different volatility characteristics, so adjust the strategy (and maybe the data feeds to include stock-specific news like earnings reports). The modular design with separated exchange adapters and pluggable strategies will facilitate this expansion
medium.com
.

Work on additional strategies: You might develop separate strategies for different timeframes (e.g. a higher-frequency strategy that mostly reacts to order book changes, or a longer swing trading strategy based on multi-day trends). The architecture should allow running multiple agents concurrently using the shared infrastructure (data feeds, etc.), each operating on different logic.

Performance tuning: As complexity grows, profile the system. Rust will give us speed, but if the LLM inference becomes a bottleneck, consider methods to speed it up (quantize the model, use GPU if available, or move sentiment analysis to a separate thread so it doesn’t block trading logic). If latency becomes critical for certain decisions, you may need to optimize network calls (e.g. keep-alive HTTP connections, or even explore direct market data feeds). According to one strategy builder, using concurrency and HTTP connection pooling reduced latency significantly when hitting the Binance API
medium.com
 – leverage such patterns in Rust.

Adding more data sources: Over time, incorporate more of the “known places” that move markets. This could include: economic calendars (for macro events like Fed meetings), forums (for retail sentiment), or even alternative data (Google Trends, etc.). Each added input should be evaluated for whether it improves the agent’s decision quality. The earlier ProfitView news bot example suggests that adding more news sources and combining news with other strategies can improve results
profitview.net
.

Fine-tune ML components: As you gather data from the agent’s performance, consider retraining or fine-tuning the decision models. For example, if using RL, periodically retrain with the latest data. If using an LLM for sentiment, you might fine-tune it on examples of news that were misclassified initially (making it more domain-aware).

Throughout development, maintain a rigorous testing discipline. Each change (whether code or strategy logic) should be tested in simulation before affecting live trades. Building an AI trading agent is an open-ended project – there is always more complexity to add – so focus on incremental improvements backed by data from tests
profitview.net
. This methodical approach will help evolve the agent into a sophisticated trader over time while managing risk.

Conclusion

By following this plan, we will create a robust AI trading agent with a solid architecture in Rust and a clear development trajectory from simulation to live trading. The agent will start by paper-trading crypto markets using a combination of technical signals and LLM-based news analysis. Rust ensures we meet the performance requirements for intraday trading (fast reaction and low overhead)
medium.com
, and the modular design makes the system extensible to new data sources and markets in the future
medium.com
. Early results and failures will be used to iteratively refine the strategy – for example, adjusting to more data inputs or smarter models as needed
profitview.net
. With careful testing, risk management, and iteration, this agent can gradually scale up to live trading and expand its domain, all while leveraging a cutting-edge AI approach to stay ahead of the market.
